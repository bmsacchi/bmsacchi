### Howdy!

My name is Bianca Sacchi, I am a PhD candidate in the Wright lab at U of T EEB.
- My current research focus is Y chromosome degeneration and silencing in plants with very young sex chromosomes.
- I love working with non-model genomes, learning new coding and bioinformatics skills, and data analysis (from frustrating data wrangling to genome visualization).
- These days I'm working on my remaining thesis projects, learning as many new skills as possible (lately: snakemake) and learning more about industry and government research careers.
- When I'm not troubleshooting code or reading papers you can find me bird watching, rock climbing, or hanging out with my cat Edgar.
