### Howdy! 🤠

My name is Bianca Sacchi, I am a PhD candidate in the Wright lab at U of T EEB.
- 🌱 My current research focus is Y chromosome degeneration and silencing in plants with very young sex chromosomes 
- 🧬 I love working with non-model genomes, learning new coding and bioinformatics skills, and data analysis (from frustrating data wrangling to genome visualization)
- 💻 These days I'm working on my remaining thesis projects, learning as many new skills as possible (lately: snakemake) and learning more about industry and government research careers
- 🤠 When I'm not troubleshooting code or reading papers you can find me bird watching 🦆, rock climbing 🧗‍♀️, or hanging out with my cat Edgar 🐈
