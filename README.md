### Howdy! 🤠

My name is Bianca Sacchi, I recently completed my PhD in the Wright lab at U of T EEB.
- 🌱 My PhD research focus was on Y chromosome degeneration and silencing in plants with very young sex chromosomes 
- 🧬 I love working with complex genomes, learning new coding and bioinformatics skills, and diving into data (from frustrating data wrangling to genome visualization)
- 💻 These days I'm working on my remaining thesis projects and learning about industry and government research careers
- 🤠 When I'm not troubleshooting code or reading papers you can find me bird watching 🦆, rock climbing 🧗‍♀️, or hanging out with my cat Edgar 🐈

### PhD projects

#### Project 1
[Y chromosome degeneration in __Rumex hastatulus__ (XYY cytotype), a plant with very young sex chromosomes](https://github.com/SIWLab/XYYmaleGenome)

- Extensive rearrangement and ~30% Y gene loss in a <10 MYA sex chromosome
- Presenting a complete, haplotype-level assembly of a species with two Y chromosomes
- Collaboration with Zoë Humphries (TE expert)

#### Project 2
[Widespread loss of Y expression in the absence of transcriptional dosage compensation in
 **Rumex hastatulus**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.20.689509v1.abstract)

- Widespread pattern of decreased Y expression relative to X expression (between gametologs)
- Increased nonsynonymous substitution rate in genes with lower Y expression
- No evidence of dosage compensation between sexes among X-linked hemizygous and silenced genes

#### Project 3
Functional gene evolution on the Y chromosomes of **Rumex hastatulus**
